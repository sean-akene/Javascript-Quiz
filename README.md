# Javascript-Quiz

## Aim
The main aim of this project was to create a timed quiz using JavaScript that records the initials and the scores of the user. 

## Features
This web application is a multiple-choice style quiz based on a series of 4 buttons as answer choices and a single question per page. The UI also features a timer at the bottom of the card as well as an index that shows quiz progress. When the timer runs out, the quiz automatically stops. 

## Usage 
To start the quiz, answer the prompt at the beginning. The timer will then begin to countdown. To move to the next question, simply pick an answer choice. At the end of the quiz or when timer runs out, you will be shown your score. 

## Installation 
The code for this application can be accessed via the github repository linked below.
